# A Sample Project Using States On Expenses

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. I will add The expense Type and price using input tags
2. Once you add the expense, total expenses is calculated using the states
3. After adding you can edit, update and delete a particular expense. Based on that total expenses price is varied automatically using states.
