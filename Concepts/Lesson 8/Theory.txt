Why do we write super(props) inside the class?
    -- If we use default constructor, by default it calls the default constructor of the super class
        As we are using parameterized constructor we should explicitly call the constructor of parent class.

why cant we have the callback function of useEffect async?
    Because React's useEffect hook expects a cleanup function returned from it which is called when the component unmounts.
    If we use async in the method itself, we might return other things, which might not return the cleanup function.

Why Do we use componentDidMount?
    componentDidMount method is called After initial render of the component and afterwards for every render, it calls the 
    componentDidUpdate method.

why do we use componentWillUnmount() ?
    As react is a single page Application(SPA) as it doesnot refresh the chrome and updates the DOM only.
    If we add any timer in the componentDidMount(), if the component removed from UI, 
    then timer continues, in order to remove timer, we use componentWillUnmount() where we stop the timer.
