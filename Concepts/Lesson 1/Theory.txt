What Is An Emmet?
   - Emmet is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow
   - It helps you write HTML and CSS faster by using simple abbreviations that are then converted into code blocks
   - Example 1:If you type like this ->
        nav>ul>li, then output is as follows
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
   - Example 2: ul>li*5, then output as follows
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul> 
   - In this way you create html code easier using emmet, instead of typing all tags which improves the fastness.

Difference between Library and Framework?
   - FrameWork:
      - The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required.
      - Therefore, It provides the blueprint and the basic framework and also shows what is still needed from the programmer in terms of customisation
   - Library:
      - The sections of code that libraries provide serve to speed up the development process of a software project and provide ready-made solutions to frequently occurring problems.
      - Libraries help developers format code more efficiently and quickly than writing it from scratch as vanilla code.
      - If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.

      React is a Library because it is developed to speed up the rendering and we are using those in our project

What is CDN? Why do we use it?
   - A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
   - A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos
   - A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks.

Why is React known as React?
   - React was developed for applications (Facebook) that have constantly changing data. 
   - Since React is a front-end framework or the “View” in MVC, this means that as the user clicks around and changes the app's data, the view should “react” or change with those user events.

What is crossorigin in script tag?
   - The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
   - Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
   - A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
   - CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.
   - CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain.
   - It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. 
   - CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.

What is diference between React and ReactDOM?
   - You use React to define and create your elements, for lifecycle hooks, etc. i.e. the guts of a React application.
   - ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. Often, you will only use it for one single thing, Mounting with ReactDOM.render(). 
   - Another useful feature of ReactDOM is ReactDOM.findDOMNode() which you can use to gain direct access to a DOM element. (Something you should use sparingly in React apps, but it can be necessary.)
   - The reason React and ReactDOM were split into two libraries was due to the arrival of React Native.
            - React contains functionality utilised in web and mobile apps. ReactDOM functionality is utilised only in web apps

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
   - Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at react.production.js
   - react.development.js are meant for only development and not suitable for production ready code

What is async and defer?
   - <script src='' />, whenever compiler executing script tag, html render stops and fetches over Internet and then executes the entire script.Then html will continue the rendering
   - <script async src=''/>, whenever compiler executing script tag, html will continue rendering until it fetches the script over Internet. Once script starts executing, stops the html rendering and completes executing od script. Once After script completed executed, then html will continue the rendering.
   - <script defer src=''/>  when compiler starts executing script tag,it bring script over Internet and Html continues to render until it finishes. Once the rendering completed, then Script starts executing.

   Generally We use Normal script tag in our code, thats the reason why we put script tag after html code as it stops rendering until it executes. So, we use script at last so that it wont stop html rendering.
